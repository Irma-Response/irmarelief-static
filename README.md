# Irma Relief

** NOTE - THIS IS A FALLBACK PLAN  & NOT CURRENTLY SERVING IRMA RELIEF WEB SITE **
Web site intended to provide information to assist survivors of Hurricane Irma.

## How to Help
- Designers. We need to design the site to provide information most important to hurricane victims. We also need it to be easy to find what we need.
- Developers. Look into the issues tab for unassigned issues marked "ready for development". Send a PR when you're done.
